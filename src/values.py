   - Optional (**Paramerter** as `str`) : `website`. The website desired by the user to start the search.
   - Optional(**Parameter** as `int`): `limit`. The limit of search results. Default 3. Max: 10. This because telegram ask for quick results. Also could be the number of threads allowed by Python.
   - Required (**Parameter** as `str`): The input by the user. No more than 30 characters.

**Requirements:** Threads, Asynchronous methods, Data Structures, APIS and libraries. Check out the compatibility with the server. If some trouble is present use Docker instead of the default files.

**Goals:**

1. The user use the command defined then the bot return the `limit` of result.

2. The bot says: **Hey choose a result that you want to see between the 1 and the `limit`**. User picks one number.

4. Depending on the page and the methods provided by the library return a bunch of result(s) to the user.


## JobQueue (Handle by `smart` command)

**Requirements:** Threads, Asynchronous methods, Data Structures, APIS and libraries.

**Goals:**

1. Basic implementation of a JobQueue. For example: A common message at the night

2. Implement a jobqueue for criptocurrency from this [API](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3#/)

3. Implementation of another APIs that can be used with the JobQueue

**NOTE**

Those tasks are just ideas that can be change with the time. Could be removed or added more depending on the case and support by the community.
